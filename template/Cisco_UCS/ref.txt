Collect full UCS Inventory
In the Admin tab, go to Communication Services. From there, check out the Call Home section. There's an option to send a full inventory to an email address. It's an XML file which you'll have to write a small parser for or import into a tool that can interpret it (you could simply load it into your web browser).

From the CLI you can also "scope chassis N" and do "show inventory expand". You can easily script this to loop through all your chassis.

scope chassis N
show inventory expand


ucspe# show chassis

Chassis:
    Chassis    Overall Status           Admin State          Chassis Profile
